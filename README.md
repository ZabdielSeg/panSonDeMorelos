# panSonDeMorelos

Sometimes pan lovers want to try new flavours or experiencies and don't know were to find them. panSonDeMorelos is a web application where people are able to look for new bakeries near to them.

As a bakery you can register and upload a bunch of photos of your panes and users can get to know you more.

This project was designed to be a complement for an instagram account in which reviews of bakeries and photos of their panes are shared.

## What it does: 
- Bakeries and every user that sells pan can register as a bakery in order to promote their products to the users. 

- Bakeries and every user that sells pan can add photos of their products as well as editing or deleting that product.

- To see all the bakeries available on the app, registration is no a must.

- Registered users can comment the bakeries where they have been before. They also are able to check a more detailed page about the place and a map to help them find the zone.

## Documentation
This app is based on express. 
npm package Passport is used for authentication. Users can register manually or using their google account.
The views are rendered using Handlebars.
One of the greates features is the usage of GoogleMaps, that helps to find and place a pin on a Map.

## Creator
The only creator is Zabdiel Segura G. It took me around 2 weeks and a half to create it.

### Special thanks
- To Betsi who helped me when troubles came.
